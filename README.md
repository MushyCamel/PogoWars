# PogoWars

This is a pogo stick fighting game.

Players must kill the other player by landing their pogostick on the other player's head in a best of 5 rounds. 
Player 1: A & D to move, SPACE to jump

Player 2: J & L to move, RIGHT CTRL to jump

Controller support (UNTESTED) should work?

Created with the help of the Unity Tanks tutorial for the GameManager
and Bracky's Youtube tutorial for camera movement. Also had some tips and help in how to achieve some aspects such as the settings menu from my friend Zeeshan.

Both were adapted to suit the game and were used as pointers.

Known bugs:
There is no delay or gap in the amount of hits registered with each raycast meaning players die instantly;
Text may not fit some aspect ratios;
Settings file has only been tested on one machine so it may throw an error;
The first round plays out while on the main menu so depending on how long the players take they may see DRAW! on the screen or not see this bug.
